      "Ever since I was an undergrad studying mathematics, I knew I wanted to open my own tutoring center one day. I love mathematics and had an even stronger love educating others in the one subject people struggled with the most. I've heard many times from students, and even friends, how much they dislike math. However, their reason is usually that math is too hard or that they just don't get it. My goal as a educator was to expose them to the beauty of mathematics, hoping for those `aha` moments whether it be sooner or later.As the years have passed, I had put this dream of mine on the side. Coming to terms with reality of the startup capital I needed in order to start a physical tutoring center was tough. Though that was the case, I was still content with educating the next generation, reaching as many students as possible. It wasn't until the pandemic did we realize that almost everything can be done remotely. Being on both sides, as a teacher and a student, teaching and learning through zoom were just as effective as in-person. Although there are some challenges with remote learning, there are also so many tools at our disposal that allow us to work effectively. And this was when I decided to create an online tutoring center, taking the first step toward the dream I had almost ten years ago.",

      "When asked what was the most popular game played during the pandemic, what comes to mind? Yes, Animal Crossing! Our Animal Crossing E-commerce site was inspired by the love and attention it garnered during the beginning of the pandemic. Though it has been around for quite some time, it wasn't until everyone had to stay indoors did this game become so popular amongst friends and family.For this project, we had obtained Animal Crossing's API to display our favorite products in the game. Our site allows users to view products, add products to cart, and buy or save to wishlist. With the thousands of products we have to offer, we created pagination and filtering to allow a smooth and easy process for users to view our products, as well as purchase as many of the same item as they want by simplying inputting the quantity of the item. Our database keeps track of our inventory and our users' order history. Administrators may also log in on the site, having access to our users and their information, and managing our products/inventory. Routes are protected for security purposes.Users have the ability to either purchase as a guest, where items in the cart persist, or to sign up for an account. Users with an account may change their username or password and view their order history. Lastly, Stripe was implemented with a confirmation page to show order has been successful.Technologies that were used in our project: Node.js | React | Redux | Express | PostgreSQL | Sequelize | JWT | Stripe | bcrypt",
